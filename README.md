_Transform and process data from Reservanto (online reservation system) to Google sheets_

My mother is a freelance physiotherapist. She has an online reservation system and would like to access statistics about her clients (e.g., how long they haven't visited or whether they have used up their vouchers).  

This package creates and updates a Google Spreadsheet with various sheets containing the data she is interested in. It provides the simplest way for her to access the information. Based on these insights, she can contact clientsâ€”for example, to remind them to book an appointment if their voucher is nearing its expiration date.

**The work is still in progress.**
